            <p>Welcome to Little Lemon Restaurant! We, Mario and Adrian, two passionate chefs, combine our years of experience and enthusiasm for food here at Little Lemon. Serving traditional Mediterranean cuisine with a modern twist, we aim to create an experience that goes beyond the food.</p>
            <p>Mario started his interest in the kitchen in his family's kitchen during his childhood. He travelled the world to explore many different cultures and integrate the unique flavours of each into his own cooking. Mario's speciality is seafood and grilled dishes in particular. Under his leadership, each dish is prepared with care, fresh ingredients and creative presentations, making it possible to discover modern Mediterranean cuisine. Mario's most popular dish is the Seafood Risotto with Lemon, an unforgettable dish made with the freshest seafood and blended with a delicate lemon flavour.</p>
            <p> Adrian started his professional culinary career in Paris as a chef in famous restaurants. With the training he received in the best restaurants in Europe, he reinforced his deep love and talent for the kitchen. Adrian is best at olive oil dishes and appetisers. His appetizers, which he has developed over the years and prepared with olive oil, fresh herbs and local ingredients, have become the favourites of our customers. Adrian's signature dish is the Baked Greek Feta. Baked with fresh herbs and olive oil, we offer this dish to your table as a warm and delicious starter.</p>
            <p>Little Lemon is not just a restaurant for us, it is a lifestyle. Our aim is to offer our customers not only a meal but also a story with every plate. We offer the fresh and natural flavours of traditional Mediterranean cuisine with a modern twist. Our mission is for every guest to have an unforgettable culinary experience.</p>
            <p>As both chefs, we take care to make the best use of fresh ingredients and blend traditional recipes with innovative methods. We make our dishes not only delicious but also visually impressive. Because at Little Lemon, we offer not only food, but a life experience.</p>
            <p>Come, spoil yourself with our delicious dishes and discover this unique experience that Little Lemon Restaurant offers!</p>
